# HackNC 2022 Competition

HackNC is an annual collegiate hackathon where students come together to create innovative software projects within 24 hours. The event promotes collaboration, learning, and the development of technical skills.

###### Motivation
Suprisingly, 1 in 4 Americans lack access to the internet, yet 97% of Americans own a cell phone.

This highlights 2 clear problems:

1. The internet plays a crucial role in the job application process. BUT, those without the internet are unable to apply for most jobs (especially high-paying jobs like those in tech).

2. The internet contains a wealth of information in the form of youtube tutorials, courses, or other online resources that can help you learn virtually anything, including new job skills. BUT, people without internet access rarely get to learn marketable skills (like coding) so they are unqualified to compete for high-paying jobs that require those skills.

###### Solution
PlatyPortal seeks to avoid using an internet connection, and instead rely on chatbots and callbots to teach people marketable skills like coding, help them build a profile to present those skills, and connect them with job opportunities. It provides a service like LinkedIn + Coursera - All without access to the internet!
